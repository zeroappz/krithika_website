									biting, injury etc.

								<li>
									<p><b>At what age one can go for orthodontic treatment?</b><br></p>
									<span>2</span>
									Acc to experts a child at the age of 7 should be brought to an orthodontist because this is the time when the new teeth
									erupt and after evaluating the teeth necessary treatment can be done(i.e. to prevent any severe problem in future).This
									is referred to as phase I treatment. The phase I treatment is for 12-21months .After this dentist gives a rest period in
									which the eruption and formation of the teeth are monitored. Then in phase II when the child turns 12-13 full braces can
									be put if the teeth are still not in the right shape.
								</li>

							</ul>

							<h4>Do adults go for this treatment?</h4>
							<p>In fact mostly the adults go for it because they want to look good and confident. There is no age bar for putting on
							braces.</p>

							<p><b>What types of braces are available?</b><br></p>

							<p>There are 3 type of braces i.e. metallic, ceramic and invisalign. Metal braces are conventional and most commonly used.
							Ceramic are very popular with adults as they look good and match with the teeth color. Invisalign are invisible and can
							also be removed. They are very comfortable as there is no use of metal brackets and wires.</p>

							<p><b>How much time is required for the treatment?</b><br></p>

							<p>On an average 22 months time is required but the time depends on individual need and problem.</p> -->
